# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on diagnostic features.

---

## üìã Project Overview

* **Model:** Logistic Regression
* **Dataset:** Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from Scikit-learn (`sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()`).
* **Features:** 30 numeric features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
* **Target:** `0` (Malignant) or `1` (Benign).

## üöÄ Model Performance

The model was trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%. To improve performance and prevent convergence warnings, the features were standardized using `StandardScaler`.

* **Training Accuracy:** 94.9%
* **Testing Accuracy:** 93.0%
